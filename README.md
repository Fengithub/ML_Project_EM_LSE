# An Expectation-Maximization Based Machine Learning Strategy to Predict Recurrence Time of Breast Cancer

a ML project done by Fen Pei, Seojin Bang and She Zhang


In this project, we proposed an improved EM algorithm called EM-Weighted LSE and illustrated its performance with 
Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer (WPBC) dataset. An expected, complete log-likelihood function was proposed to 
utilize both recur and non-recur data, as well as a new definition of error. Ten-fold cross validation results shown 
that EM-Weighted LSE outperformed two baseline methods (Gaussian Linear Model and Recurrence Surface Approximation) 
in terms of errors for all data, non-recur data, as well as recur data respectively. 
The results indicated that EM-Weighted LSE is applicable in handling right-censored data, 
and is able to predict an accurate recurrence time for breast cancer patients.
